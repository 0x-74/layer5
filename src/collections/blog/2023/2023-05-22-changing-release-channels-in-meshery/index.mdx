  Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes
  being added regularly. To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and
  updates, you can switch between different release channels.
</p>
<p>
  Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two
  different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both
  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and
  stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much
  more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that
  merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each
  merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.
</p>
<p>
  There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using
  mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we'll cover
  both methods.
</p>

<br />

<h3>
  Switching between Meshery release channels by editing your meshconfig file.
</h3>

<br />
Another way to switch between Meshery release channels is by editing your config.yaml
file. This file is typically located in the <code>~/.meshery</code> directory. Here's how:

<ol>
<li>
  Open your config.yaml file in a text editor.
</li>
<li>
  Find the channel field in the meshery section of the file.
</li>
<li>
  Change the value of the version field to the desired release channel, stable
  or edge.
</li>
<li>
  Save the changes to the file.
</li>

<li>
  To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again:

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">mesheryctl system channel view</code>
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
  After making these changes, future updates to Meshery will use the selected
  release channel.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.</h3>
<br />

<p>
  mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here's how:</p>
<p>
  Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  <code>mesheryctl version</code>. If you don't have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl">Meshery documentation</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Run the following command to see the current configuration for
  Meshery:
</li>

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">mesheryctl system context view</code>
</pre>

<img src={MesheryVersion} className="image-center-no-shadow"></img>

<p>
  This will show you the currently channels ,<b>stable</b> or <b>edge</b>, along with the version number and other information.
</p>

<li>Run the following command to switch to a different release channel: 
<pre><code class="language-bash">mesheryctl system channel set [stable|stable-version|edge|edge-version]
</code></pre>

  This command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected
  channel for future updates.To set the channel to a specific version, replace <code>version</code> with the desired version number.

</li>



<li>
  To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again:

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">mesheryctl system channel view</code>
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<br/>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>

<p>
  Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward
  process. You can do it using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file.
  Whether you want stable updates or bleeding-edge features, Meshery has a
  release channel that suits your needs. Just remember to carefully consider
  your use case and needs before making any changes to ensure that you have the
  best Meshery experience.
