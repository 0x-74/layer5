bio: In a world where code rules supreme, there lived a maverick who dared to challenge the status quo. Meet Azan, also known as "The Code Maverick", a software developer who isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what's possible. With a deep understanding of multiple programming languages and a passion for innovation, Azan creates services, applications and APIs that run seamlessly across multiple platforms and runtime environments and are as unique as they are functional. But Azan's rebellious spirit extends beyond his work. He's also an open-source advocate, working on projects that promote freedom and accessibility. In his free time, Azan can be found exploring new technologies, experimenting with unconventional approaches, collaborating with other developers or just doodling.
